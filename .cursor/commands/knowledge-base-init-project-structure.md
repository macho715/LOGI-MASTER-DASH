# /knowledge-base init-project-structure
Initialize or refresh a concise knowledge-base view of this monorepo.

- Treat `C:\LOGI MASTER DASH` as the repo root; map `apps/`, `packages/`, `src/`, `supabase/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, and `hvdc_output/`.
- Cross-check with `AGENTS.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md` when describing responsibilities and data flow.
- Produce three sections: (1) a short tree view, (2) 3–5 bullets per top-level area, and (3) links or references to the most important docs.
- Do NOT edit files automatically unless the user explicitly asks; propose README/SETUP/STATUS changes instead.
- Optimize the output for onboarding a new engineer in ≤ 2 minutes of reading time.
